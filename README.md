## Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Developing Front End Apps with React" course.<br>
A React application was created as a final project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart App.<br>
<br>
With this application, users can select plants in an online plant shop and add them to the shopping cart.<br>
<br>
Home screen:<br>

After clicking on the “Get Started” button, the selection that the user can make appears.<br>
Examples:<br>

The user receives feedback when making a selection, which improves the user experience.<br>
See, for example, the grayed-out button on selection or the number of products in the shopping cart at the top right.

Once the selection has been made, he can display the contents by clicking on the shopping cart.<br>
If necessary, the quantity can be increased or decreased.<br>

If the user still has requests and would like to display the product list, they can click on the “Continue Shopping” button.<br>

The implementation of the checkout button was not part of the project.<br>
To inform the user of this, an alert is displayed when the button is clicked:<br>

## Getting Started
If you want to visit the website: Visit the link in the GitHub repository.<br>
<br>
If cloning / forking code: The project was developed using the IBM Cloud IDE.<br>
Setup not tested on private IDE.<br>
<br>
Setup description from the course (slightly modified for my own project) in the IBM Cloud IDE:<br>
1. Clone repository
2. Change terminal path to folder "paradise-nursery-shopping-cart-app". E.g.:
```
cd paradise-nursery-shopping-cart-app
```
3. Install necessary packages to execute the application using npm:
```
npm install
```
4. Execute this command to run the application, which will start the application server running on port number 4173.<br>
In IBM Cloud IDE there was an extra feature for this, where the port was entered and the application was started.<br>
```
npm run preview
```

5. The application can be stopped with Ctrl + C.<br>
Step 4 must be repeated for each change to be visible.<br>
<br>
If changes are made to the code, these must be deployed so that they are displayed on the hosted GitHub Pages website.<br>
First install the required packages as in step 3.<br>
Then enter the following command:<br>
<br>

```
npm run deploy
```

This commits changes in the gh-pages branch and updates the website.<br>
A success message appears in the terminal:<br>
